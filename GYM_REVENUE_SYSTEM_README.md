WHERE summary_date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- This month's revenue
SELECT total_revenue, total_transactions 
FROM monthly_revenue_summary 
WHERE month_year = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE);

-- Revenue growth (month over month)
WITH current_month AS (
    SELECT total_revenue FROM monthly_revenue_summary 
    WHERE month_year = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
),
previous_month AS (
    SELECT total_revenue FROM monthly_revenue_summary 
    WHERE month_year = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month')
)
SELECT 
    cm.total_revenue as current_month_revenue,
    pm.total_revenue as previous_month_revenue,

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance & Optimization

### 1. **Regular Maintenance**

DELETE FROM gym_revenue 
WHERE revenue_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 years';

-- Update statistics
ANALYZE gym_revenue;
ANALYZE daily_revenue_summary;
ANALYZE monthly_revenue_summary;
```

### 2. **Performance Monitoring**
```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    attname,
    n_distinct,
    correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE tablename LIKE '%revenue%';

-- Check index usage
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE tablename LIKE '%revenue%';
```

## üîí Security & Access Control

### 1. **User Permissions**
```sql
-- Grant read access to revenue data
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO revenue_viewer;

-- Grant full access to revenue management
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO revenue_manager;
```

### 2. **Data Validation**
- **Check Constraints**: Enforce valid revenue sources and categories
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintain data consistency across tables
- **Audit Trail**: Track all changes with timestamps

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Triggers Not Working**
```sql
-- Check if triggers exist
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%revenue%';

-- Manually execute functions
SELECT update_daily_revenue_summary();
SELECT update_monthly_revenue_summary();
```

#### 2. **Missing Data**
```sql
-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gym_revenue gr
LEFT JOIN users u ON gr.user_id = u.id
WHERE gr.user_id IS NOT NULL AND u.id IS NULL;

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT 
    revenue_source,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN amount <= 0 THEN 1 END) as invalid_amounts
FROM gym_revenue
GROUP BY revenue_source;
```

#### 3. **Performance Issues**
```sql
-- Check query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM gym_revenue 
WHERE revenue_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Optimize slow queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_gym_revenue_date_source 
ON gym_revenue(revenue_date, revenue_source);
```
