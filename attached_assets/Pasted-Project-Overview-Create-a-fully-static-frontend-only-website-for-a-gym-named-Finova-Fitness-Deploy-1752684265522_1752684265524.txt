Project Overview
Create a fully static, frontend-only website for a gym named Finova Fitness. Deploy it on Vercel; no backend services. Use placeholder data and dummy content for all features. The color scheme should be neon accents on black background, with a neon-style Finova Fitness logo (e.g. a dumbbell icon with text). The UI must be highly animated, visually appealing, and user-friendly.
General Requirements
Implement an initial portal selection/login page: users choose which portal to enter (Public/Non-Member, Member, Trainer, Nutritionist, Admin, Front Desk). The Public/Non-Member portal requires no login; other portals have a mock login form (accept any input as success) that then shows the appropriate portal.
Use a neon and black theme consistently: neon colors (bright green, blue, pink, etc.) on dark backgrounds. Accent buttons, icons, and highlights with glowing neon effects.
Add a floating AI chatbot icon on every page (bottom-right). Clicking it toggles a chat window with a mock AI assistant. Pre-load sample Q&A in the code: e.g. on public pages include "Which membership is best for me?" with a sample answer; on member pages include questions like "Recommend leg day exercises" or "What should my macros be?"; on trainer pages "Suggest warm-up drills for a HIIT session"; on nutritionist pages "Generate a 1500-calorie meal plan for a 65 kg user"; on admin pages something like "Which location lost the most members last month?". Provide dummy answers for each query.
Ensure the site is highly animated and interactive: use CSS animations/transitions for buttons, modals, and content sections (sliding or fading in). For example, animate CTA buttons with hover glows, and make form transitions (like multi-step wizards) smooth.
