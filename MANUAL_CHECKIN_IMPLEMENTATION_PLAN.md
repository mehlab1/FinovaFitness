# Manual Check-in Implementation Plan
## Finova Fitness Front Desk Portal Enhancement

### Project Overview
Implement comprehensive manual check-in functionality for the front desk portal that allows front desk users to search for active members, check them in, track consistency, and award loyalty points. The system will also update the member portal's consistency card based on weekly check-in patterns.

### Requirements Summary
- **Member Search**: Search by name, email, or member ID with autocomplete
- **Active Members Only**: Show only members with active subscriptions (not expired/paused)
- **Multiple Check-ins**: Allow multiple check-ins per day per member
- **Real-time Tracking**: Record exact date and time of each check-in
- **Consistency Tracking**: Track weekly consistency (5+ days per calendar week)
- **Loyalty Points**: Award 10 points for consistency achievement
- **Recent Check-ins**: Display recent check-ins on front desk portal
- **Member Portal Integration**: Update consistency card in member dashboard
