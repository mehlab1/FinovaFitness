# Public Store Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a complete public store system for non-member users of the Finova Fitness website. This system allows guests to browse products, add items to cart, and complete purchases without requiring account creation.

## Backend Analysis

### Existing Backend Infrastructure
The backend already had a robust store system with full support for guest users:

**Key Backend Features:**
- ✅ Complete e-commerce backend with categories, products, cart, checkout, orders
- ✅ Guest user support with `guest_email`, `guest_name`, `guest_phone` fields
- ✅ Public APIs (no authentication required) for store operations
- ✅ Inventory management and stock tracking
- ✅ Order processing and status management
- ✅ Payment method support (online/in-person)

**Public API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/store/categories` - Get all categories
- `GET /api/store/items` - Get all items with filtering
- `POST /api/store/cart` - Create guest cart
- `POST /api/store/cart/items` - Add items to cart
- `GET /api/store/cart/:cart_id` - Get cart contents
- `POST /api/store/checkout` - Process checkout
- `GET /api/store/orders/:orderNumber` - Get order by number
- `GET /api/store/orders/email/:email` - Get orders by email
